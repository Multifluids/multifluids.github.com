</figure>
In this numerical experiment a set of fluvial channels are considered. The domain is characterised by an aspect ratio of 1:50. The wetting phase is injected over the right boundary and the left boundary is the only open boundary. The dynamic mesh is adapted to the saturation field, introducing the majority of the resolution at the shock-front.
